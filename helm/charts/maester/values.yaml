  #  We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  #  choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  #  resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  #  lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
